# InfLib (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, UNUSABLE)
### A library full of Infinite Yield plugins and commands to download with the click of a button.
##### *Inspired by Kaizerfox‘s Infinite Store*

# How to Download
##### If not already done, go to your File Explorer > View and enable "File name extensions"
#### - Go to your exploit‘s "workspace" folder then add a file in it called "InfLib.txt"
#### - Open it and put in this script:
```return loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flamespill/InfLib/refs/heads/main/Core/Main.lua"))()```
#### - Rename the file from "InfLib.txt" to "InfLib.iy", a pop-up will appear asking if you really want to change the filename extension, press Yes
#### - Now execute Infinite Yield and input the following command: ‘addplugin InfLib‘

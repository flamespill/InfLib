# InfLib (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, UNUSABLE)
### A library full of Infinite Yield plugins and commands to download with the click of a button.

# How to Download
##### If not already done, go to your File Explorer > View and enable "File name extensions"
#### - Go to your exploit‘s "workspace" folder then add a file in it called "InfLib.txt"
#### - Open it and put in this script:
```return loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flamespill/InfLib/refs/heads/main/Core/Main.lua"))()```
